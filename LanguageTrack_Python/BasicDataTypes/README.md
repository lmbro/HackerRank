# Description

Intro to basic data types in Python.

We must move forward! I use Python 3.

## lists.py

lists and a few of their methods

string.split() method to split a string, unsurprisingly

## tuples.py

tuples, though nothing more than than storing mutliple int input in a tuple

hash function, though only printing the result of using it

## list_comprehensions.py

list comprehensions - a shorthand and very "pythonic" way to build lists. I did this is lists.py, but this example shows how to use nested loops and conditionals.

## second_largest.py

while loop
and operator

## nested_lists.py

lambda functions ( used for sorting a list of lists based on an index in the nested list )

## percentage.py

dictionaries
string format specifier
